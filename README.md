A GTK3 rewrite of KanjiPad, a Japanese Handwriting recognition software

<b>Why rewrite kanjipad</b>

Kanjipad is a great software, but it's also quit old and cannot be compiled
with the later version of GTK2 and of course with GTK3 .

So I rewrite it using GTK3, Glade and Cairo, keeping most of the engine as-is. 

<b>Similarites with Kanjipad</b>

* Almost the same user interface layout
* Uses the same engine (JStroke)

<b>Differances with KanjiPad</b>

* Use GTK3: Cairo, Glade and non deprecated widgets
* Code simplified and commented
* JStroke is now integrated at compile time instead using a separate software
  (KanjiPad <-stdin-> KPengine <-linked-> Jstroke). At the cost UI / Engine full
  separation, but at the benefits of a much more clear code.  
* Prettier, thanks to Cairo and GTK3 theme.


<b>TODO</b>

* Color chooser menu for the strokes and background
* background and stroke colors default values from system colors
* set stroke width
* Option to append several kanji in the clipboard / erase clipboard and push kanji (current)
* Save settings
* about dialog
