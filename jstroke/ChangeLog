	* scoring.c (StrokeScorerTopPicks): One-line fix to the SJIS code
	calculation to avoid sign extension problems, and fix off by 0x100
	problem with JStroke 1.1 that was reported by Peter Cumpson.

	* scoring.c (StrokeScorerTopPicks): Added SJIS:HHHH notation to
	list to give ShiftJIS codes suitable for entry into Canon
	Wordtank, as requested by Peter Cumpson <pjc2@npl.co.uk>.

	* *.[ch]: Merged in the changes made by Owen Taylor
	<owt1@cornell.edu> to split the sources into a more modular set of
	files, and isolate the Pilot dependencies.  Went a bit further and
	broke out jstrpilot.h, maybe added another file or two myself.
	Added emacs magic on top line to set mode nicely, adapted from
	Owen's emacs magic at the bottom of the file.
